# OwO? What is this?
Addon plugin for the Extended Weapon Customization mod for *Warhammer 40,000: Darktide*. Adds various parts I felt like adding, mostly intended for use with screenshots. A responsible mod author would spend the time making sure these parts are aligned for various combinations of parts. I ain't that kind of author.

Report alignment issues and I might fix it if I'm not busy rotting.

Parts are prefixed with `OwO`.
