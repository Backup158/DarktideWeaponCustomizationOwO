# 2025-09-UNRELEASED
v0.1.0

Initial release for the rebuilt version in Discord

Laying the framework for me to readd parts
- functions for each group of attachments (ex suppressors together)
- functions to add a group of attachments to a weapon (or multiple at once)
- functions to copy over attachments to another weapon
    - used to propagate changes from mark to mark
    - and from family to family (ex ilas --> recon)

Added
- Suppressors
    - Infantry/Braced/Vigilant Autoguns, Infantry Lasguns
