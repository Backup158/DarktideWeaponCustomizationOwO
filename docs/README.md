# OwO? What is this?
Add-on plugin for the Extended Weapon Customization (EWC) mod. Adds various parts, mostly inspired by history (more like history-inspired films and games) and tacticool airsoft guns. Intended mainly for use in screenshots. 

> [!WARNING] 
> Expect alignment issues and performance drops, especially when piled onto a heavy load order. A responsible mod author would spend the time making sure these parts are optimized and are compatibly aligned with all the other pieces. It ain't me.
> 
> I've also noticed hitches when opening the inventory/weapon customization menu and on startup.

Because of misaligned sights, I recommend using [Crosshair Remap (Continued)](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/253) as a workaround. Error 2001/2014s when entering the Mourningstar can be kinda avoided by directly accessing the mission board through [Psych Ward](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/89) or some other equivalent, but it won't save you from getting disconnected at the start of a mission. I've only had trouble connecting at the start; once you're in, you're probably in until the end.

Report alignment issues and I might fix it if I'm not busy (lying umder blamket ^u^).

# ***Notices youw pawts*** (Parts I added)
Parts are prefixed with `OwO` in the customization menu.

> **Part**: Weapons available
> 
> &emsp; Description

## Muzzles

- **Suppressors**: Infantry/Braced/Vigilant Autoguns, Infantry/Helbore/Recon Lasguns, Heavy Laspistols, Combat Shotguns, Quickdraw Stub Revolvers  \
  &emsp; 1 and 2 are generic suppressors  \
  &emsp; ﻿3 is based on the PBS-1  \
  &emsp; ﻿4 and 5 are different generic suppressors, but they're bigger and more metallic
- **Lasgun Condom**: Infantry/Braced/Vigilant Autoguns, Infantry/Helbore/Recon Lasguns  \
﻿  &emsp; To cover up the heat discoloring. Aligned for Helbore-based barrels.
- **Muzzle Brake**: Infantry/Braced/Vigilant Autoguns, Infantry/Helbore/Recon Lasguns  \
  &emsp; ﻿Anti-Materiel Rifle muzzle brake based on the Barrett M82. Use it with the MT Single Stubber barrels.

## Barrels
- **Dreg Gunner Barrel**: Braced/Infantry/Vigilant Autoguns
- **M16 Barrels**: Infantry/Braced/Vigilant Autoguns  \
&emsp; 2 versions based on the a1. 1 on the a2. The a1 variants are very scuffed lol.  \
&emsp; ﻿Regular variants are aligned with EOTech holographic sights. By aligned, I mean the front post is aligned with the reticle. Kinda like absolute cowitnessing but without the rear sight (so not really cowitness lol). Pretend you have a rear flip sight flipped down, I guess.  \
&emsp; ﻿Tall variants are aligned with the telescopic and M16 carryhandle sights.  \
&emsp; ﻿No post variants have no front post. The front post blocks most other sights, so I recommend using these for those.
- **Wooden Helbore Barrels**: Helbore Lasguns  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿MAS inspired
- **Plasma Rifle Barrels**: Helbore Lasguns  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Rectangular plasma rifle barrel.
- **Short Shotgun Barrels**: Bolt Pistol  \
&emsp; ﻿Short variants that extend the barrel a little. Super short variants extend it a little less (wow such detail).
- **Shotgun Barrel Extension**: Snubnosed Revolver  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Short and long variants. Short fits typical revolver barrel length. Long goes a bit beyond that.

## Foregrips
- **Tactical Foregrips**: Infantry/Braced/Vigilant Autoguns  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Angled foregrips, mostly like the iconic Magpul one
- **Straight Foregrips**: Infantry/Braced/Vigilant Autoguns  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Foregrips perpendicular to the barrel, which will clip with your off hand (this is why the MT plugin uses slanted foregrips).

## Bayonets
- **Dreg Gunner Bayonet**: Infantry/Braced/Vigilant Autoguns  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Only really aligned with the Dreg Gunner Barrel
- **Historical Pack**: Infantry/Braced/Vigilant Autoguns, Helbore Lasguns.  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Based on US M7 Bayonet, German Seitengewehr 98, and French Épée-Baïonnette Modèle 1888
- **Underbarrel Grenade Launchers**: Braced/Infantry/Vigilant Autoguns, Infantry/Helbore/Recon Lasguns  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Based on M203 and GP25
> [!WARNING]
> ﻿KNOWN ISSUE: Both variants will steal muzzle flashes from infantry autoguns
- **Underbarrel Shotguns**: Braced/Infantry/Vigilant Autoguns, Infantry/Helbore/Recon Lasguns  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Based on the Knight's Armament Company Masterkey and the M26-MASS (Modular Accessory Shotgun System)  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Masterkey includes smaller and larger variants
> [!WARNING]
> ﻿KNOWN ISSUE: Both variants sometimes steal muzzle flashes from bullet-based weapons

## Receivers
These can get super janky when using non-default parts so watch out.
- **Vertically Challenged Bolter Receiver**: Spearhead Boltgun  \
&emsp; ﻿Makes the gun and magazine vertically shorter. This one is just janky all around. Use with the 'Cadia' Complaint grips from the MT plugin.
- **Bolt Action Helbore Receivers**: Helbore Lasguns  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Adds a grip to the back to mimic a bolt
- **MAS-49 Helbore Receivers**: Helbore Lasguns  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Makes the rear blockier and metallic... er
- **Massive Slide**: Heavy Laspistols  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿(WIP) Makes the top a giant slide. Moves magazine inside the grip (with a little bulge :3). Be warned when using this because I only spent an hour before deciding I didn't care enough.
> [!WARNING]
> ﻿KNOWN ISSUE: Has a random magazine in first person

&emsp; ﻿﻿Fallout 4 10mm lookin ass mf

## Sights
- Sight_2, **Alternative Viewmodels**: Braced/Infantry/Vigilant Autoguns, Autopistol, Bolter, Bolt Pistol, Infantry/Helbore/Recon Lasguns, Laspistol, Combat/Double Barrel Shotguns, Stub Revolvers  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Equipped in the helper sight section, these change how you hold the gun while ADSing, but keeping the physical appearance of the scope on your gun.  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Point Shooting, DOOM aiming, CS:S Zoom (think SG-552 Commando zoom), and Hipfire aim
- **Ladder Aperture Sights**: Helbore Lasguns  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Based on WWI style iron sights. No front posts though so good luck aiming with just the U notch.  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Includes very shoddily made MAS49 inspired sights. These look ugly as sin since the receiver is so wide and I'm too lazy to resize them.
- **AK Irons**: Infantry/Braced/Vigilant Autoguns  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Adjustable rear notch sight  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Aligned for the long Braced Autogun barrel with the Infantry/Braced receiver  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Includes variant with dust cover (that I wish I could make wider). I also left two scuffed variants that I made before I realize there was already an elevation ladder in the game lmao.
- **M16 Carry Handle Irons**: Infantry/Braced/Vigilant Autoguns  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Sight aligned with M16 Barrels (Tall). Versions with and without the rear elevation wheel since I don't think a1's have them.
- **Holographic Sights with Magnifier**: Braced/Infantry/Vigilant Autoguns, Recon Lasguns, Bolter, Bolt Pistol, Snubnosed Revolvers  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Based on EOTech HWS and Vortex Razor AMG.  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Adds standalone holographic sight, holo with magnifier to the side, and holo with magnifier lined up (with options for 2 zoom levels).  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿﻿You can choose all 3 sight pictures by using the sight_2 options from the MT Plugin.  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿﻿Holo with magnifier lined up includes variants for zoom.  \
﻿﻿&emsp; ﻿Includes short variant that doesn't clip with the receiver, but blocks more of the sight picture.  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Supports the Volleygun receivers from Syn's Edits.
- **Telescopic Sights with Red Dot Sight**: Braced/Infantry/Vigilant Autoguns, Infantry/Helbore/Recon Lasguns, Bolter, Bolt Pistol, Snubnosed Revolvers  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Adds standalone ACOG sight and SUSAT sight. Includes variants for different zoom and with RDS stacked on top.  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿﻿ACOG doesn't have bullet drop compensation crosshair ticks.  \
&emsp; ﻿&emsp; ﻿Uses the default Darktide reflex pictures, equipped through sight_2 options.  \
&emsp; ﻿&emsp; ﻿Includes backwards variants where it's placed closer to the back of the weapon; certain (small) weapons don't have enough space to do this so both positions are the same.  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿﻿SUSAT uses the German post, obelisk-shaped reticle.  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Versions to aim through the main sight and the red dot (top).  \
&emsp; ﻿Sight aligned with M16 Barrels (Tall)  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Supports the Volleygun receivers from Syn's Edits.
> [!WARNING]
> KNOWN ISSUE: SUSATs will steal the lasers from lasguns.
>

- **Straight Grip and Stock**: Helbore Lasguns  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Recon stocks with revolver grips are based on Elysian Drop Troop sniper lasguns.  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Anti-materiel rifle stocks are based on the Barrett M82 with the rear grip.  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿These will clip into your hands during regular use, which why the other plugins use slanted grips
- **Tactical Stocks**: Braced/Infantry/Vigilant Autoguns, Autopistols, Infantry Lasguns, Bolter, Bolt Pistol  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿﻿Skeletal stock  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿﻿Folded stocks: Stock attached to a hinge and folded to the left or right  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿﻿Folded stocks (natural): Stocks with hinges built-in. Folded left/right/under
- **Kalashnikov Stocks**: Braced/Infantry/Vigilant Autoguns  \
&emsp; ﻿Bigger stocks rotated to resemble the stocks on Kalashnikov rifles  \

- **Mag Assists**: Infantry/Braced/Vigilant Autoguns  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Based on the Magpul magazine pulls
> [!NOTE]

- **Plasma Magazines**: Helbore Lasguns  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Literally just the magazines from the plasmagun.  \

## Flashlights
- **Trigger Guard Laser**: Heavy Laspistols, Quickdraw Stub Revolvers  \
&emsp; (WIP) Moves the laser pointer in front of the trigger guard.
> [!NOTE]
﻿> The lasers will NOT work unless you modify files in weapon customization manually. By default, they appear as flashlights. I'll try and see if there's a better way of doing this.

## Heads
- **Tactical Axe Spike**: Combat/Tactical Axes  \
﻿Spike on the back of the tactical axe head. Fills in the holes in the blades.

## Body
- **Rapier Blade**: Dueling Swords  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Thin, straight blades
- **Historical Knives**: Combat Blades  \
&emsp; ﻿Based on the M1917 Trench Dagger, Gerber Mk II, Indonesian karambits, and tanto blades.  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿﻿Karambits come in regular/short and curved forwards/backwards (and they're all very scuffed lol)  \
﻿﻿&emsp; ﻿Tantos are basically the MT Combat Sword blades but skinnier and shorter, so I didn't bother aligning them outside the default case.

> 
> Shovels are cursed (not really I'm just a lazy bitch).

## Front Guard

﻿&emsp; ﻿New slot. Curved hilt in front of the grip to protect your fingers.  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿Includes knuckle duster variants, where you have 1-4 small guards in front. 

# FAQ
1) **THE GAME STARTED AND I GOT A BUNCH OF ERRORS!**

&emsp; HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

&emsp; *ahem* Make sure you put this above the MT/Syn plugins. Also make sure you have their latest full releases (just the ones on Nexus). If that doesn't fix it, drop a [console log](https://dmf-docs.darkti.de/#/faqs?id=how-do-i-report-mod-errors) in the posts. I probably messed up in that case so sorry for laughing so hard.

2) **This mod gave me a backend error!**

&emsp; ~~Oh I'll give you a bac~~ You're missing a requirement for EWC

3) **X attachment is unaligned when used with Y!**
   
&emsp; Yeah that's what happens when I'm lazy. Send a screenshot of the customization menu and I'll try and get that fixed eventually. Delivery date depends on rotting status.

4) **The sights don't line up with where I'm shooting!**

&emsp; Send a screenshot of the customization menu and misalignment, and I'll see if it's the same on my end. If I can replicate it, I'll try to fix it. If not, it could be a settings mismatch (see spoiler).
<details>
  <summary>Settings mismatch</summary>
  
First of all, I aligned these sights under specific conditions:  \
&emsp; ﻿I'm using the default FOV but have Weapon FOV set for arbitrary values per weapon >:3  \
&emsp; ﻿I'm using the default reticle size in the EWC mod options  \
&emsp; ﻿I'm using Constant FOV but allow changes from aiming  \
If your settings differ, that's probably causing the issue. From then on, you have two options

1) ﻿﻿For non-physical reticles, remove the reticle and aim using the crosshair from Crosshair Remap. To remove the reticle, open the customization menu and equip one of the following:  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿&emsp; ﻿﻿MT Helper scope (Clear)  \
&emsp; ﻿﻿&emsp; ﻿﻿Invisible sight_2
2) ﻿﻿Align the scope for yourself. I made a [little guide](https://backup158.github.io/Darktide_EWC_Edits.html#AligningSights) for this.

5) **My scope/bayonet is stealing the muzzle flash from my gun!**
   
&emsp; yeah :( I'll fix that eventually  \
&emsp; Oh, and also make sure you aren't using a "No muzzle" option for the muzzle. You need to use "Invisible muzzle" for that (That's part of Syn's plugin. May add that myself for people who don't use that).

6) **When I use the scopes in game, they glitch out and are impossible to aim with!**

&emsp; This is a consequence of the mesh streamer system. You can avoid it by disabling it in `<Darktide>\bundle\application_settings\settings_common.ini` but this will likely have disastrous consequences for your FPS. See the spoiler for more details.
<details>
  <summary>Mesh streamer issues</summary>
  
The mesh streamer basically makes it so your computer only renders things in high quality if it's close and visible, so it won't use up as many resources on, for example, a Scab Shooter's helmet 70 meters away. Sometimes, it'll set your sights as low priority, so you'll be aiming through a garbled mess throughout the match. This tends to happen more for users with AMD GPUs, which includes me lol.

By disabling it, you guarantee that the game won't eat up your weapons. This also means the game is rendering every detail at full quality, even the small things far away.
  
```
﻿mesh_streamer_settings = {
    disable = true
}
```

7) **What do you mean by "intended for screenshots" ?**

&emsp; It means I'm mostly concerned with how the weapon looks like when inspecting it. Clipping with animations and during use is not important here. For example, the Elysian grip-stock for the Helbore does not line up with your hands at all, but it's more accurate to one depiction of the Accatran Mk IVe Modified Sniper Lasgun.

8) **How am I supposed to aim with the Alternative Viewmodels if I'm not using the scope?**

&emsp; You use the crosshair, laser, or simply feel it out. To enable crosshair/laser, see the [FAQ in my hidden viewmodels mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/461) because I'm too lazy to copy and paste more than I already have.

<details>
  <summary>Going a bit into the technical details here</summary>
  
9) **Why is performance so bad?**

&emsp; EWC runs worse as weapons get more attachment slots. I added a lot of slots for all those accessories, which increases the background processing during matches.

&emsp; Error 2014 comes from your game taking too long to respond to the server; with this plugin, EWC has to spend more time processing the extra slots while loading in, which may or may not be enough of a delay to boot you. Could just be a nocebo effect, but I figured it was worth mentioning anyways (and now I have cursed you >:3).

&emsp; It's not literally unplayable, but caveat emptor.

10) **Ok but can I do anything about this?**

&emsp; Aside from the workarounds I posted in the main description, there's some small things but no silver bullets.
  - Disable raytracing in your user_settings.config file. There's a bit more options there even when you turn it off through the in-game menu. Just don't touch rtxgi_scale.
  - Turn off Visible Equipment in the EWC mod options
  - For out of memory crashes, apply the lua heap memory increase band-aid fix (--lua-heap-mb-size 2048 in the Steam launch options)
  - If you crash at the end of missions, try setting locked packages to 'Always' in the EWC mod options (which will make performance worse but hopefully lessen crashes). Didn't help with disconnects but YMMV.

11) **Why does this require the MT plugin?**
  
&emsp; MT's plugin includes functions that make creating parts from multiple pieces much easier. I used them.

12) **Why does this need to be above the other two plugins?**

&emsp; I piggybacked off of some of the slots they already added to lessen the performance hit. The way parts get added to slots means that if the mod is lower in the load order than the mod that adds the slots, it either just won't work or will wipe out the parts added by the original slot creator. Also the alignments I mentioned earlier.

##
</details>

13) **XYZ part is historically inaccurate!**

&emsp; Yeah could be. My sources mostly start at Wikipedia articles, old forum posts, and random people posting videos themselves shooting things. Everything I made was based on some picture I saw, which may not have necessarily reflected the majority. If you could include some sources for me to throw into my Darktide mod autism folder to review later, I'll try and make an attachment like it. Though if it's something like a knob being 2 cm off, you can just edit the mod yourself lol. I made a [guide](https://backup158.github.io/Darktide_EWC_Edits.html) for that.

14) **Can you add XYZ?**

&emsp; Maybe. Leave a picture and the attachment's name in the posts or the Discord thread, and I'll think about it.
Keep in mind that I can only use parts already in the game, and I'm not the most creative person.
