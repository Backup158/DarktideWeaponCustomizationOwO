# OwO? What is this?
Addon plugin for the Extended Weapon Customization mod for *Warhammer 40,000: Darktide*. Adds various parts, typically inspired by history. Intended mainly for use in screenshots, with in-game performance secondary to appearances. 

**!!!!!**

**Expect issues and _noticable_ performance drops. A responsible mod author would spend the time making sure these parts are compatibly aligned with all the other pieces and optimized. I ain't that kind of author.**

I've gotten a lot more Error 2014s once I added this. You have been warned!

**!!!!!**

Report alignment issues and I might fix it if I'm not busy (rotting in bed).

Parts are prefixed with `OwO`.
