# OwO? What is this?
Add-on plugin for the Extended Weapon Customization (EWC) mod. Adds various parts, mostly inspired by history (more like history-inspired films and games) and tacticool airsoft guns. Intended mainly for use in screenshots.

Because of misaligned sights, I recommend using [Crosshair Remap (Continued)](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/253) as a workaround. Error 2001/2014s when entering the Mourningstar can be kinda avoided by directly accessing the mission board through [Psych Ward](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/89) or some other equivalent, but it won't save you from getting disconnected at the start of a mission. I've only had trouble connecting at the start; once you're in, you're probably in until the end.

Report alignment issues and I might fix it if I'm not busy (lying umder blamket ^u^). 

Parts are prefixed with `OwO`.

If you don't follow this, ~~I'll tear out your liver~~ the mod will throw a bunch of errors and I will laugh at you for not reading the description. You'll also miss out on the 2 times I aligned something involving the other plugins' parts.
> [!NOTE]
> To AML users: Due to (what I believe to be) limitations with AML, load order can be inconsistent and throw errors. Trying to find a workaround at the moment.
